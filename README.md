# MyHotel Management Application
 MyHotel Management Application is an application developed with Objective-C to manage different types of rooms and services. The application provides the following services: 1- Each customer reserving a room has a profile in the system containing name, id, address, the time period of reservation, type of the room. 2- When a customer makes a reservation of a particular room, he can add some extra services (sauna, fitness center, etc). The application manages a waiting list to add customers to if the hotel is full. 3- The application gives employees the information about the roomâ€™s status, such as: searching for a room by its number in order to check the room status (reserved or unreserved), displaying all unreserved rooms and their types. 4- The application allows the employees to reserve a room for a customer and then release it when the customer leaves the hotel or he`s canceling the reservation. 5- When a customer leaves the hotel, the application displays a bill for him and how much the customer paid and how much should he pay before leaving the hotel when he/she is about to leave. 6- The application has an employer management system as well.
